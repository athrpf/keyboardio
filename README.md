This repository holds my keyboard layouts for keyboardio.

First, follow the getting started guide for arduino here: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/wiki

Then, replace the keyboard layout code with that in this repo.

The sub-directory `Model100_hapi` is a sub-directory of Documents/Arduino on my windows machine.

This is quite useful for debugging: https://codepen.io/QDeltaE/pen/PjXWZr
